# Banking Application

## Objective

Your assignment is to build an internal API for a fake financial institution using Python and Django. 

## Brief

You are tasked with an assignment to replicate one of, if not, the most well-defined Banking application well known to man. Well, at least that's what your Boss said. Actually, you're supposed to replicate a Banking system because your team want to simulate what it's like to serve a live-service application with top notch security.

Unfortunately (or fortunate), you are the only Backend Engineer in the team. All decisions regarding system design will be made by you!
As a talented engineer. You know by heart that, functionality of creating account, inquiry, transaction history, deposit, withdraw, and transfer should be bare minimum. Some sort of authorization is obvious enough as well.

However, since you are your own boss. You are free to add any *nice-to-have* functionality that you believe it'll benefit users. Still, you will have to be able to explain to your friend why you spend your precious time on them.

Your application should be able to run on your teams' machines. Otherwise, they will be severely disappointed.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Python best practices
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
- Documentation: is the API well-documented?

### CodeSubmit
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
